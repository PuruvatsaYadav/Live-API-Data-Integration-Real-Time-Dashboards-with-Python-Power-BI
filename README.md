Live API Data Integration: Real-Time Dashboards with Python & Power BI: 
This project focuses on building a live, interactive dashboard showcasing key global statistics such as health, education, employment, and other indicators. Data is sourced from a public API updated with the latest information. 
Using Python, we create a script that automatically fetches data and processes it for Power BI, ensuring a live data connection. The dashboard refreshes automatically without manual updates, making it highly efficient and reliable 
for ongoing monitoring. It provides easy-to-understand visuals like charts and graphs, helping users explore trends and patterns across countries and regions.

Objectives:
1. Understand the overall economic and social landscape by analyzing key development metrics.
2. Calculate the average GDP per capita and assess trends in international markets.
3. Evaluate average GDP spending on health relative to GDP to identify national health investment priorities.
4. Assess the proportion of total area classified as forest, affecting land use, agriculture, and natural resource policies.
5. Compare health spending patterns across world regions to highlight disparities and inform health outcomes.
6. Track trends in key indicators (e.g., forest area, mobile subscriptions, internet, GDP, renewable energy, health, unemployment) over time.
7. Evaluate the impact of internet access on immunization awareness and its potential to improve health information access.
8. Assess the role of internet access in reducing unemployment levels.
9. Identify underperforming countries in poverty reduction efforts.
10. Highlight top-performing countries in poverty reduction.
11. Examine interrelationships among health indicators (e.g., health expenditure, life expectancy, immunization rates, child mortality, disease burden).
12. Investigate the relationship between government spending on health and life expectancy trends.

This project provides valuable insights for policymakers, NGOs, and donors to focus resources effectively and shape integrated health strategies.
